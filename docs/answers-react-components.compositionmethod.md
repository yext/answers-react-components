## CompositionMethod type

The method of combining a component's built-in CSS classes with custom CSS classes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type CompositionMethod = 'merge' | 'replace' | 'assign';
```

## Remarks

Merge keeps the component's built-in classes and adds the custom classes to them (default). Replace ignore all of the componentâ€™s built-in classes and only uses the custom classes. Assign keeps the component's built-in classes, however custom classes will completely override their associated built-in classes.

## Example

Suppose a component has a built-in theme of `{ icon: 'Icon', button: 'Button' }`<!-- -->, and it is provided a custom theme of `{ icon: 'Blue' }`<!-- -->. The various composition methods would result in the following composed themes: Merge: `{ icon: 'Icon Blue', button: 'Button' }` Replace: `{ icon: 'Blue' }` Assign: `{ icon: 'Blue', button: 'Button' }`
